This is a traffic light and rail crossing controller that intended to run on QNX. It was written for a fourth year group assignment as apart of RMITs Real Time Systems course. While the assignment was a group assignment, the code contained was written solely by Dale Giancono and Hanuman Crawford. The purpose of the assignment was to help students to become familiar with pthreads, concurrent processing, scheduling, timers, and other aspects of real time systems. The project itself was implemented using Quartus and Momentics, however only the bare bones code is included for reference.

For a more detailed outlook on the project and the implementation of the project, please refer to the final report.
